When I have time to kill,I usually like to surf the internet to play close attention to new fashion trade.
Such as the fashion week,respectively,new york fashion week,paris fashion week,London fashion week and milian fashion week.
The test of time,I usually go to the library to find some valuable books and a park to relax myself.
There are many books to my taste,such as fashion magazines,inspirational books,and professional books.
These books can make me healthier and energetic.
And last thing I'd like to do when I have tried all the restaurant in our community!
